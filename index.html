<p>Hi, my name is Ryan Young and I am a student at Drexel University. I am currently pursuing my BS in Software engineering and my MS in Computer Science with a concentration in artificial intelligence. My passion is robotics and it has been for the last 5 years. In high school I participated in FIRST robotics for three years and still continue to mentor at my high school. I also do research on HUBO the humanoid robot at drexel. More information on my volunteering as a software mentor and my research and experience with Hubo and other robots is below. </p>

<p>I am a proud member of team 3167, the Environmental Tectonic Crusaders and have been for 5 seasons. When I was a part of the team in high school I was the head programmer for my team. I learned a lot about robots and the software systems that are used to control them thanks to the help of my amazing mentors. This was where my first interest in robotics was formed and it has stuck with me ever since. During my time in high school I was interested in all aspects of robotics and learned how to machine parts and wire the robot. I was immersed in an interdisciplinary field during my high school years and have had a drive to learn I that I can about it since.  </p>

<p>For the last two years I have volunteered to be the software mentor for my high school team. I believe that I was very lucky to have kind and helpful mentors that helped me find my passion in life and I try to be a positive influence in all of the high school students that I help. When I am at the robotics shop helping with the robot and software development I no longer sit at the computer and code the robot myself. Instead I encourage collaboration between the students and help facilitate productive conversation in addition to offering advice to the students who are doing the coding. Just because I am not doing the coding doesn't mean that I am not learning however, I learn many new interpersonal skills by working with and leading the team 3167 software development team. </p>

<p>The majority of my current work revolves around software development for HUBO the humanoid robot. I have worked on everything about the robot from reassembling the leg to developing an active balancing system to fixing broken wires with solder and wire wrap. HUBO has taught me many different things including introducing me to ROS and giving me a solid foundation on linux system administration. </p>
